.SH NAME
rsuplnk \- User entry into the ROSE network.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rsuplnk [-q] <port>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B rsuplnk
program allows a user to gain entry into the ROSE network using the standard
pseudo-digipeating method. Recent Linux kernels are aware of this form
of operation and the
.B ax25d
program can listen for such connections. The normal mode of operation of a
ROSE switch is to have one ROSE address (ie port) per physical AX.25 port.
Therefore ROSE users coming in on a given AX.25 port will appear as if they
come from the associated ROSE port. This is the reason for the need for a
ROSE port as an argument.
.LP
To use
.B rsuplnk
you need an entry in
.B ax25d.conf
to listen for incoming connections. In the example below, I will be
listening for ROSE connections on my AX.25 port 144 using the callsign
KE4GAJ-10 and the ROSE port associated with the AX.25 port is rs144.

There would typically be one
.B rsuplnk
per user access AX.25 port. The associated program for exiting a ROSE
network is
.B rsdwnlnk.

All errors generated by
.B rsuplnk
are written to the system debug log file.
