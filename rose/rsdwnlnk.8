.TH RSDWNLNK 8 "29 April 1997" Linux "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
rsdwnlnk \- User exit from the ROSE network.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rsdwnlnk <port> <call>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B rdwnplnk
program allows a user to leave the ROSE network using the standard
pseudo-digipeating method. Recent Linux kernels are aware of this form of
operation and the
.B ax25d
program can create such connections. The normal mode of operation of a
ROSE switch is to have one ROSE address (ie port) per physical AX.25 port.
Therefore ROSE users coming in on a given ROSE port will come out of the
associated AX.25 port.
.LP
To use
.B rsdwnlnk
you need an entry in
.B ax25d.conf
to listen for incoming ROSE connections to any callsigns that are not
matched by the more specific ROSE entries. In the example below, I will be
listening for ROSE connections on my ROSE port rs144, the exiting AX.25
connection will be via the associated AX.25 port, 144, using the callsign 
KE4GAJ-10. Please note that the callsign should be on the same line as the
rest of the command, it may be wrapped onto the next line on your screen.

There would typically be one
.B rsdwnlnk
per ROSE port. The associated program for entering a ROSE network is
.B rsuplnk.

All errors generated by
.B rsdwnlnk
are written to the system debug log file.
