AX25 Tools
==========

Note that kissattch has changed its command line format slight.  While the
old format will work, the -i option is now, err, not optional.  This was
done to stop the million or so emails we get on linux-hams email list
saying why do people get axports unconfigured even after a kissattach 
command.
